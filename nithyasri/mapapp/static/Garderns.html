        "Selvamari Gardens" likely refers to a real estate development called Sabari Gardens in Koovathur, Chengalpattu, or it could be a misspelling of the large botanical garden project planned for Chengalpattu district. The planned botanical garden will be a 138-hectare facility with various themed gardens and educational programs, and Sabari Gardens is a residential project in Koovathur.
